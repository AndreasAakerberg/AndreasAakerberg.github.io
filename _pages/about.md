![alt text](images/teaser.jpg "Title")

I’m an **Assistant Professor** in the [Visual Analysis & Perception (VAP) Lab](https://www.en.create.aau.dk/research/research-groups/visual-analysis-and-perception) at Aalborg University’s Department of Architecture, Design, and Media Technology, a **Research Consultant** with [Milestone Systems A/S](https://www.milestonesys.com/), and a member of the HPC Advisory & Governance Board at the [Danish Pioneer Centre for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/) (P1). I earned my Ph.D. in **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision** from Aalborg University in 2023 under supervision of [Kamal Nasrollahi](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/117162) and [Thomas B. Moeslund](https://thbm.blog.aau.dk/).

My research sits at the intersection of **computer vision, image reconstruction, and computational photography**, with a focus on high-impact, real-world challenges e.g. within surveillance and forensics. I master building solutions end-to-end, from problem framing and dataset design to model development and deployment on embedded/GPU platforms, and I’ve authored multiple patents in image processing. I teach **Deep Learning, Image Processing & Computer Vision, Machine Vision & Machine Learning, and MLOps**, and I co-lead research projects while supervising BSc/MSc/PhD students. 

I’m motivated by producing state-of-the-art research that delivers reliable, and measurable impact in practice and by delivering teaching that sparks interest, deepens understanding, and equips students with actionable skills.
