Thermal object detection must remain reliable as object and background appearance drifts across time of day, weather, and season. We tackle this challenge with an appearance-guided Mixture of Experts (MoE) that learns to route each image to a subset of specialized backbones. A self-supervised appearance encoder produces embeddings that drive a lightweight router; experts are pretrained on clusters of these embeddings to encourage specialization, and all experts share a single detection head to avoid the linear growth in parameters typical of ensembles. At inference, we adopt a tuning-free, compute-aware policy that activates the fewest experts whose cumulative routing probability exceeds a fixed threshold. Training is stabilized with complementary batch- and sample-level load-balancing losses that prevent expert collapse and promote diverse routing. On LTDv2 (natural long-term drift) and FLIR ADAS (simulated drift), our MoE achieves the highest peak accuracy and superior month-to-month ranking consistency, demonstrating that appearance-guided routing provides more reliable performance across diverse thermal conditions than monolithic scaling. The result is a practical and scalable detector that remains accurate under distribution shift and adapts its compute at test time.
