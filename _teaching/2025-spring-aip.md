AI-programmering (MED6) is a practical intro to AI from classical pattern recognition to modern deep learning and search. Students learn about probability & statistics (random variables, covariance, Mahalanobis distance), core ML concepts (features, supervision, metrics, over/underfitting), and deep learning fundamentals (ANNs/CNNs, training loops, autograd, optimizers, schedulers, losses, data loaders). The course blends short lectures with hands-on exercises and a mini-project focused on building working solutions.
