Perception and Acquisition of Data (CE7/CE9/ES7/ES9) introduces how to plan, capture, and evaluate real-world data for vision and audio applications. The visual track covers cameras and the human visual system, exposure/lighting, camera calibration, data quality, annotations, dataset design, and a mini-project where students produce an end-to-end capture plan. The audio track covers recording fundamentals, speech and music signals, stereo/binaural techniques, and audio-visual integration, with a practical analysis hand-in. Teaching blends lectures, labs, and workshops.
