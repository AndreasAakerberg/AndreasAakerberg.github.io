Deep Learning (DAKI3) gives a practical, end-to-end introduction to modern DL. Students learn core concepts (ANNs, CNNs, training/optimization, regularization, reproducibility) alongside a short math refresher, then build and deploy models with PyTorch/TensorFlow on AAU AI-Lab (Linux, GPUs, containers). Topics include CNNs for vision, advanced architectures (RNNs/GRUs/LSTMs, GANs, diffusion, attention/Transformers, ViT), transfer/self-supervised learning, and basics of XAI and uncertainty. The course mixes lectures with hands-on labs, a mini-project, and exercises focused on real-world tooling and performance.
