Image Processing & Computer Vision (PDP8) blends theory with practice to teach how computers understand images and video. After foundations—pixels, color spaces, point processing, convolution, morphology, and blob analysis—students tackle robust features (Harris, HOG, SIFT/ORB), motion (background subtraction, optical flow), tracking (Kalman, mean-shift, multi-object), modern CNN-based vision, and an intro to point clouds.
