**Drift af AI-systemer (DAKI4 / MLOps)** is a hands-on course on taking ML from notebook to production. Students build an end-to-end MLOps pipeline covering **reproducibility and config**, **CI/CD** (branching, pre-commit, unit tests, GitHub Actions), **scalable training** (multi-GPU/DDP, multi-node, AMP, DeepSpeed/ZeRO), **scalable inference** (profiling, quantization, pruning, batching, TensorRT), **deployment** (APIs, containerization/orchestration, mobile demo), and **monitoring** (drift, observability with Prometheus/Grafana, carbon/cost tracking). Post-deployment topics include **continual learning, unlearning, privacy**, and **human-in-the-loop**.
